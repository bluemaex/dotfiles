#### `bin`-folder

Contains binary files or scripts that should be executable. It will
be symlinked to `~/.bin`.
ls
#### `etc`-folder

All dotfiles that do cool stuff.

#### `osx`-folder

Configuration stuff for macOS that I regularly tend to search for again. Also contains configurations for a few apps that allow custom preference paths.

## install

Make is your friend. If you don't know how to start enter ``make help`` so you see all executable targets with a description.

## credits

Probably the credits list is not complete because it grew over the years. If you find a credit missing please ping me, I'll add it. Thank you internet for all the good dotfiles and inspirations.
