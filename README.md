# .bluemaex aka my dotfiles

Yes, well.

#### `bin`-folder

Contains binary files or scripts that should be executable. It will
be symlinked to `~/.bin`.
ls 
#### `etc`-folder

All dotfiles that do cool stuff.

#### `osx`-folder

Configuration stuff for macOS that I regularly tend to search for again. Also contains configurations for a few apps that allow custom preference paths.

## install 

Make is your friend. If you don't know how to start enter ``make help`` so see all executable targets.


## credits 

I stole most of this stuff together to form my own complete setup. Most probably the credits list is not completely because it grew over the years. If you find a credit missing please ping me, I'll add it.
